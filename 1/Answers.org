This code accepts the variables ~a~ and ~b~, and if ~b~ is positive, it adds ~a~
and ~b~. However, if ~b~ is zero or negative, it subtracts them. This decision
is made by using the ~+~ and ~-~ procedures as the results of an if expression,
and then evaluating according to the results of that expression. This is in
contrast to a language like Python, which would do something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :noeval :tangle no
if b > 0: a + b
else: a - b

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is
faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He
defines the following two procedures:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme -n :noeval :tangle no
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
#+END_SRC
Then he evaluates the expression

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme -n :noeval :tangle no
(test 0 (p))
#+END_SRC

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

In either type of language, src_scheme{(define (p) (p))} is an infinite
loop. However, a normal-order language will encounter the special form, return
~0~, and never evaluate ~(p)~. An applicative-order language evaluates the
arguments to src_scheme{(test 0 (p))}, thus triggering the infinite
loop.

Exercise 1.6: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a
special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of
cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and
she defines a new version of if:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme -n :noeval :tangle no
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
#+END_SRC
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme -n :noeval :tangle no
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
;; => 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
;; => 0
#+END_SRC

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme -n :noeval :tangle no
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
#+END_SRC

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

Using Alyssa's ~new-if~ leads to an infinite loop because the recursive call to
~sqrt-iter~ is evaluated before the actual call to ~new-if~. This is because
~if~ and ~cond~ are special forms that change the way evaluation is handled;
whichever branch is chosen leaves the other branches unevaluated.

The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be very effective
for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers,
arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This
makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with
examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alternative
strategy for implementing good-enough? is to watch how guess changes from one
iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of
the guess. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does
this work better for small and large numbers?

Newton’s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the
value:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\frac{x}{y^2} + 2y}{3}
\end{equation}
Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root
procedure. (In 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton’s method in general as
an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)

However, this will hang on an infinite loop when trying to run src_scheme{(cbrt 100)}.
I speculate it's a floating point precision issue with the "improve"
algorithm. So to avoid it I'll just keep track of the last guess and stop
improving when there's no more change occurring. Also while researching I
discovered that (again due to floating point) src_scheme{(cbrt -2)} loops
forever unless you initialize your guess with a slightly different value, so
let's do 1.1 instead.

This is repeated exponentiation. This operation is to exponentiation, what
exponentiation is to multiplication. It's called either /tetration/ or /hyper-4/

I believe the space to be \(\Theta(n+d)\) as the function calls count down the
denominations before counting down the change. However I notice most answers
describe \(\Theta(n)\) instead, maybe I'm being overly pedantic and getting the
wrong answer.

My issues came finding the time. The book describes the meaning and properties
of \(\Theta\) notation in [[http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2_002e3][Section 1.2.3]]. However, my lack of formal math
education made realizing the significance of this passage difficult. For one, I
didn't understand that \(k_{1}f(n) \leq R(n) \leq k_{2}f(n)\) means "you can
find the \(\Theta\) by proving that a graph of the algorithm's resource usage is
bounded by two identical functions multiplied by constants." So, the graph of
resource usage for an algorithm with \(\Theta(n^{2})\) will by bounded by lines
of \(n^{2} \times some constant\), the top boundary's constant being larger than
the small boundary. These are arbitrarily chosen constants, you're just proving
that the function behaves the way you think it does.

Overall, finding the \(\Theta\) and \(\Omega\) and \(O\) notations (they are all
different btw!) is about aggressively simplifying to make a very general
statement about the behavior of the algorithm.

I could tell that a "correct" way to find the \(\Theta\) would be to make a
formula which describes the algorithm's function calls for given input and
denominations. This is one of the biggest time sinks, although I had a lot of
fun and learned a lot. In the end, with some help from Jach in a Lisp Discord, I
had the following formula:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{ceil(n / val(d))} T(n - val(d)*i, d)
\]

But I wasn't sure where to go from here. The graphs let me see some interesting
trends, though I didn't get any closer to an answer in the process.

By reading on other websites, I knew that you could find \(\Theta\) by obtaining
a formula for \(R(n)\) and removing constants to end up with a term of interest.
For example, if your algorithm's resource usage is \(\frac{n^{2} + 7n}{5}\),
this demonstrates \(\Theta(n^{2})\). So I know a formula *without* a \(\sum\)
would give me the answer I wanted. It didn't occur to me that it might be
possible to use calculus to remove the \(\sum\) from the equation. At this point
I knew I was stuck and decided to look up a guide.

After seeing a few solutions that I found somewhat confusing, I landed on [[https://codology.net/post/sicp-solution-exercise-1-14/][this
awesome article from Codology.net]]. They show how you can remove the summation,
and proposed this equation for count-change with 5 denominations:

\[
T(n,5)=\frac n{50}+1+\sum_{i=0}^{n/50}T(n-50i,1)
\]

Which, when expanded and simplified, demonstrates \(\Theta(n^{5})\) for 5
denominations.

Overall I'm relieved that I wasn't entirely off, given I haven't done math work
like this since college. It's inspired me to restart my remedial math courses, I
don't think I really grasped the nature of math as a tool of empowerment until
now.

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the
approximation \(\sin x ≈ x\) if \(x\) is sufficiently small, and the
trigonometric identity \(\sin x = 3\sin\frac{x}{3} − 4\sin^3\frac{x}{3}\)
to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an
angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than
0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

This graph shows that the number of times ~sine~ will be called is logarithmic.
- 0.1 to 0.2 are divided once
- 0.3 to 0.8 are divided twice
- 0.9 to 2.6 are divided three times
- 2.7 to 8 are divided four times
- 8.5 to 23.8 are divided five times

Given that the calls to ~p~ get stacked recursively, like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :noeval :exports code
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
(p (p (p (p 0.14950000000000002))))
(p (p (p 0.43513455050000005)))

(p -0.7895631144708228)

:END:
Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses
successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt.
(Hint: Using the observation that \((b^{n/2})^2=(b^2)^{n/2}\), keep, along with
the exponent \(n\) and the base \(b\), an additional state variable \(a\) , and
define the state transformation in such a way that the product \({ab}^n\) is
unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process \(a\) is taken to
be 1, and the answer is given by the value of \(a\) at the end of the process.
In general, the technique of defining an /invariant quantity/ that remains
unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of
iterative algorithms.)
