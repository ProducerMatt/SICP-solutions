;; Exercise 1.10: The following procedure computes a mathematical function
;; called Ackermannâ€™s function.

(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))

;; What are the values of the following expressions?

;; MattsDiary: I think I'm supposed to evaluate these by hand. (Last words of
;; man found dead at keyboard)

;; (A 1 10)
(A (- 1 1)
   (A 1 (- 10 1)))
(A 0
   (A 1 9))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 0
                     (A 0 2))))))))
;; ^ The human made an off-by-one error! Foolish meatbag!

;; (A 2 4)
(A 1
   (A 2 3))
(A 1
   (A 1
      (A 1
         (A 1 1))))
|#

#| This time the worthless meatbag got caught up in substituting x-- and forgot
to put the real x back in. Last sexp should be (A 2 1). It didn't matter this
time because x is used as a condition to end evaluation but never is used in the
value returned! This is probably the sort of thing that algorithm wizards notice
without running headfirst into it. |#

;; (A 3 3)
(A 2
   (A 2
      (A 2
         (A 2 1))))
;; Cool! This one hangs! Great. :)

#|
;; It was another off-by-one, what I should have written was:
(A 2
   (A 2
      (A 2 1)))
;; We really invented computers for a reason huh?

;; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))

;; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
;; procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n)
;; computes 5n^2.
