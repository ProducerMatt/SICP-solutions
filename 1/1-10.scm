;; Exercise 1.10: The following procedure computes a mathematical function
;; called Ackermannâ€™s function.

(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))

;; What are the values of the following expressions?

;; (A 1 10)
;; (A 2 4)
;; (A 3 3)
;; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))

;; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
;; procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n)
;; computes 5n^2.
