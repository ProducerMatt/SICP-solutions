#+TITLE: My SICP Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to exercises from the legendary textbook
/Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming/, or from associated
problem sets and projects.

I am doing solutions with Guile Scheme. In the past, I used heavily-commented
Guile files combined with occasional Jupyter notebooks. Now, I'm using org-mode
with Guile code blocks, plus Gnuplot for drawing plots. I hope to add a Nix file
at some point so it's easy for others to load all the needed dependencies and
mess around with my code.
